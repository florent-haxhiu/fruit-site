# Fruity

This is a quick site on some fruits.

I just want to refresh my memory on creating a backend and frontend then linking them together.

My frontend will be done in **Next.js** and my backend will be done **Django**.

For my frontend, the tech stack I will be using is

- `Sass`
- `Next.js`
- `Axios` -> To fetch information from the backend

For now, I will be continually updating this if need be.

As for my backend I will be using

- `django`
- `psycopg2-binary`
- `autopep8`
- `djangorestframework`
- `pylint`
- `pyjwt`
- `django-environ`

This will also get updated if I add any new packages.
